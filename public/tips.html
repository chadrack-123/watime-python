                <p><strong>1) Feed Your Lawn</strong><br>
                Regular lawn care is important for maintaining a lush, healthy yard. You should only fertilize your lawn in the spring.
                Our top tip is to fertilize your lawn only when rain is expected. The water will dissolve the fertilizer
                into the soil to reach the roots.
                If it doesn’t rain soon, use a hose to water generously.
                You should notice results in a week, with evidence of a greener lawn.

                There are many types of weeds, and your lawn may have been exposed to at least one. Removing weeds is essential for aesthetics and the health of your lawn.
                You can either pull the roots and weeds up by hand or use a tool. If the area affected by weeds is large, consider investing in a nontoxic herbicide.

                Although it is not everyone’s favourite outdoor job, it is essential. It is a good idea to cut the grass every other week during the summer, and every other week throughout the year. Regular mowing improves grass spread and leaves fewer spots.

                While moss can look beautiful in natural settings like forests, it can be a problem in lawns. Poor drainage can lead to moss growth. Spring is the best time to address moss problems.

                A good lawn requires regular watering. You should water your lawn often, especially if it’s new. A healthy lawn can survive without much water, except in drought situations.
